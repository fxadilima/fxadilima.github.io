# Mengenai Jian Long Zai Tian 

Jian Long Zai Tian 见龙在天 = Melihat Naga Di Langit

Before concluding this discussion of the bottom-to-top organization within single hexagrams, it is appropriate to consider the case of Qian 乾䷀ “Vigorous” (#1) hexagram, the first—and best known—hexagram in the Zhou Changes. The line statements of this hexagram are organized around the image of a dragon or dragons (long 龍), the descriptions of the dragon changing from line to line based on its position in the hexagram. Since these images are the best known line statements in the entire text, and have motivated countless metaphors throughout Chinese literature and culture, they merit detailed discussion here.10 We can begin with a simple translation of the hexagram text.

First Nine: Submerging dragon. Don’t use.

九二：見龍在田。利見大人。
