# ðŸ¦… Cerita Silat

The content is Indonesian translation of Jin Yong[^jin-yong] novel, Divine Eagle Shooting Heroes[^original-title].

I am trying to translate this novel into Indonesian based on the English version, which actually is _fan translated_,
so in order to get the real meaning of certain Chinese terminology, you are advised to read the original novel,
which in turn was published by Hong Kong Commercial Daily from 1957, January 1 - 1959, May 19.

[^original-title]: The original title is She Diao Ying Xiong Zhuan (å°„éµ°è‹±é›„å‚³).

[^jin-yong]: Louis Cha, more popular by his name as a writer, Jin Yong.
